# Welcome to the Grapes Repo! 

In this repo you will find data from pathogens that impact grapevines. The goal of this repo is to use this data to analyze and examine pathogen diversity.

Make sure to read the docs for BOTH hyphy-develop and hyphy-analyses. These external repos will allow you to run useful commands on the data.
Once you run the hyphy-develop code, CLONE THE hyphy-analyses REPO AND CD INTO IT TO USE IT.
